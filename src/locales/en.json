It is optimized for scaling dapps of all shapes and sizes, and enables secure asset transfers between chains. \n\nBasechain already has secure bridges to the major blockchains, Ethereum, Binance Chain, and Tron — with Bitcoin, Cosmos, and more in the works.",

The users of the network help choose the validators they want to run the network. They do this by “staking” or “delegating” their LOOM tokens to validators  —  giving validators their support by proxying their tokens to them.\n\nAny LOOM token holder can choose which Basechain validators they wish to support.

(Also see: <u>What are validators?</u>)\n\nFor example, if a validator had a fee of 30%, it would mean they would take 30% of the rewards listed in the table above, and you would keep the remaining 70%.\n\nEach validator’s fee level is published on the [Validators page](https://wallet.loomx.io/validators) of the Basechain Dashboard so that users can make informed decisions prior to staking.\n\nFor additional info on fees and rewards, see [this post on validator and staking economics](https://medium.com/loom-network/plasmachain-validator-staking-economics-part-1-e816d5825849).",
