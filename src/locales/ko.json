Through “delegation”, users support validators by proxying their tokens with those valdiators’ staking pools. The validator candidates with the largest pools become the official validators of the network. By staking your LOOM tokens, you can help choose the best validators to ensure the strongest possible security and performance for PlasmaChain (and you can earn rewards by doing so — see below). The more people who delegate and actively contribute, the more secure the chain.",

This means they will forfeit a portion of their staked tokens, including the tokens that have been delegated to their pool. Slashing helps deter malicious behavior and maintain a system whereby everyone is playing by the same rules. It is designed to make dishonest and faulty behavior more costly than it’s worth.
