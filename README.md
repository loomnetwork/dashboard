# Plasmachain Staking and Validator Dashboard

Set the following environment variables before running anything:
- `WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` - should be set to the project ID generated by WalletConnect Developer Cloud.
- `INFURA_PROJECT_ID` - should be set to the project ID generated by Infura.
- `NODE_ENV` - should be set to `PRODUCTION` for production deploys.
- `EXT_VALIDATORS_URL` - should be set to the API endpoint that provides additional information about
                         validators.

To run it:

```
yarn run serve
```

To build it:

```
yarn run build
```

Part of the build step is prerendering the pages, which uses puppeteer to drive a headless chrome browser. Make sure to install all dependencies.
